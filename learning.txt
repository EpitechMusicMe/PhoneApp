Spotify API usage in MusicMe:

Parts of Spotify for developers:
- Web Playback SDK - for playing songs ON THE WEB.
- Android SDK (Spotify App Remote) - for playings songs ON MOBILE by connecting to an existing Spotify app.
- Web API - REST HTTP API

Android SDK has two parts:
- Authentication SDK - auth, need to ask for permission, i.e. for remote playback.
- App Remote SDK - remote playback, includes auth with limited permissions.
